# SafeSurf: Chrome Extension for Censoring Toxic Text

## Overview
SafeSurf is a Chrome extension designed to create a safer online environment for children. Utilizing advanced Machine Learning algorithms, it detects and censors toxic text on web pages in real-time, ensuring that young users are shielded from harmful content.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Instantly identifies toxic text as the page loads.
- **Smart Censorship**: Intelligently blurs out offensive words, phrases, or sentences.
